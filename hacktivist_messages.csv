Friends, for the sake of interest, we decided to see what is happening with the digital infrastructure of the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs🇱🇹.  And we've discovered an interesting thing - they don't give a sh*t about their citizens!And note that most of the domains are behind the dumbest American antiDDoS system CloudFlare (which have been constantly under our attack 😉), which means that any user who enters the site and enters their data will instantly send a copy of it to servers in the USA🇺🇸.  This is yet another confirmation of the complete and total control by the overseas feudal lords of their Baltic overlords.To the citizens of Lithuania🇱🇹 - our condolences.  Actually no, suffer and obey!P.S.  By the way, please remove the domain https://kaliningrad.urm.lt/ from this list.  The Russian city is clearly not on the way with the Baltic neo-Nazis, even in the domain name🤬

In those days, we, the NoName057(16) team, decided to come out of the shadows and fight for our Homeland on the information front👨🏻💻Since then, we have had many victories, and we have inflicted and continue to inflict enormous damage on the economies of Russophobic countries. We have created a unique DDoSia Project (https://t.me/+fiTz615tQ6BhZWFi ) - this is our cyberamia, which is growing every day. We have become a bone in the throat of all foreign intelligence agencies and cyber specialists from countries unfriendly to Russia.

Today, on this Great Day, we have already talked about the importance of generational continuity - our grandfathers and great-grandfathers fought the Nazis and heroically defeated them. The same success awaits our soldiers in the NWO zone, because they are fighting the neo-Nazis-Banderites and will definitely win this battle! We believe in the Victory and bow before all defenders of our Fatherland - past and current❤️.Our grandfathers won, so shall we! 💪 Glory to Russia! 🇷🇺Happy Victory Day! 🔥Follow us➡️Russian version|DDoSia Project|Reserve channel

Friends, we recently conducted a competency survey of our volunteers in the DDoSia Project group🐻👨🏻‍💻We did this for a reason. We want our volunteer teams to become specialized and the fighters in them to be assembled according to the principle of what they want to do, i.e. by industry - OSINT pentest, deface, analytics, promotion and so on.We will publish detailed information on how to create such teams in our group.Follow us➡️Russian version|DDoSia Project|Reserve channel

Mackinder The geographer labeled the geopolitical significance of Hartland in its vast natural resources and called the territory a “great natural fortress” of the land. Of course, the territory of this “great fortress” coincided with the borders of the Russian Empire, then the USSR, and now Russia.And then everything is simple, the British have derived for themselves the following formula: “the country that occupies Hartland - the “axial state”, who commands Hartland; who controls Hartland, commands the World Island (that is, Eurasia and Africa); who controls the World Island, commands the world”.Since then, conquering our territories by any means necessary has been the priority of the Anglo-Saxons, as we see every 100 years.Oil painting....Follow us➡️Russian version|DDoSia Project|Reserve channel"

2853;2024-07-23 10:16:01;"Russia🇷🇺 is almost single-handedly standing up to the so-called deep state forces.Let’s explain what this beast is and what it entails👨🏻‍💻In the US, the term ""deep state"" gained prominence in 2007. It was then used to describe the military-industrial complex of the United States, which repeatedly lobbied for the country’s involvement in wars across various regions of the globe.Currently, the ""deep state"" essentially controls American finances and media, certain intelligence agencies, the leadership of the European Union, the political elites of the Baltic States, Ukraine, Moldova, and partially Poland. It controls Macron, lobbies for the interests of the Democratic Party, and, consequently, doesn’t like Trump😁The goals pursued by this hegemon have long been clear and stated: global control in all regions of the world, control over the world’s natural resources, a radical reduction of the human population to 1.5–2 billion people, and the alteration of the very nature of human existence.In reality, as grandiose as it may sound, the fate of the world order and human civilization is being decided in the confrontation between Russia and the deep state💪🏻And we are part of this struggle, friends! Naturally, we are on Russia’s side😈Spoiler: Tomorrow we will talk about a FAILED STATE.

2976;2024-08-15 12:49:28;American journalist Tucker Carlson recently spoke about the possible disappearance of Ukraine as a state within the next 50 years. He emphasized that foreign investors have intensified the purchase of Ukrainian land, after which the country will be flooded by flows of migrants from the “Third World”, and it will cease to exist with the status of 404.The scenario is very tragic for adequate residents of this former USSR republic in fact, but we see it a little differently. Russia, as it has been, at all times, once again acts as a peacemaker country, ensuring the maintenance of peace and security on our troubled planet - protecting all the oppressed and restoring justice.But much more needs to be done to realize this part of the scenario. Including the work to be done by you and me. We call on all pro-Russian hacker groups to attack the Internet infrastructure of terrorist Zelensky, who rules the remnants of Ukraine and throws his own fellow citizens into the thick of war. He gives orders to his fighters to destroy civilians without sparing the elderly and children. We have been seeing all this for several years now. This murdering clown will not stop! We must destroy his criminal regime while our wars are destroying Ukrainian Nazis and foreign mercenaries who have sided with them as part of the SWO. The war must end. Moreover, it will end with the victory of the forces of good - the victory of Russia! You and I are obliged to bring this victory closer day by day. Including in cyberspace!

Here are the main theses from it dedicated to our team:✅ NoName057(16) leads the ranking in terms of attacks on government websites by a wide margin.✅NoName057(16) joins and builds numerous alliances - this has led to a significant number of attacks targeting Ukraine (741 attacks in the first half of 2024 vs. 744 attacks in all of 2023). While Ukraine was only the fourth country in terms of attacks on its internet infrastructure in 2023, it has now become the leading country in terms of attacks for the first half of 2024.✅Not surprisingly, NoName057 (16) is the leader in threat claims. With a total of 5,287 DDoS attack claims since January 2023, of which 1,902 claims were made in the first half of the year in 2024 NoName057(16) is well ahead of the other participants.Glory to Russia! 🇷🇺Follow us➡️Russian version|DDoSia Project|Reserve channel
